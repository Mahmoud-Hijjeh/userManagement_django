A Django application that allows users to register, log in, reset, and change their passwords. 

## Features üìå
- User registration with the option to create a new user

- Sending password reset emails to actual email addresses 
- Authenticate using an external service 

## Back-end
- The back-end of the application is built using Django (Python Framework)

## URLs üåç

- `accounts/login/` for logging a user into your application 
- `accounts/logout/` for logging a user out of your application
- `accounts/password_change/` for changing a password 
- `accounts/password_change/done/` for confirming a password change 
- `accounts/password_reset/` for requesting a password reset email

## User Registration üìù
Django doesn‚Äôt provide user registration by default. However, Django offers forms that can be used in your projects such as `UserCreationForm` which contains all the necessary fields to create a new user, excluding the email field. 

## How to Add URLs üíª
To add these URLs to your project, you will need to include them in your project's URL configuration file. 

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
